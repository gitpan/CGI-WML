Module: CGI::WML

Description:
    CGI::WML provides WML output and WML methods for CGI programming.
    The purpose of the module is to retain the familiar CGI.pm way of
    programming to enable experienced CGI programmers to use their
    existing skills when creating WAP applications.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.004, CGI.pm (>=2.79), HTML::Parser, HTML::TokeParser,
    HTML::TableExtract and XML::Parser
   
    The XML::Parser dependancy can be removed at compile-time.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation supported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3)...
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
    I don't know how to install Perl modules on Windows platforms, if
    someone could provide directions so I can include them here I would
    be grateful.

Planned Enhancements:
	Add support for new standards for WAP2 and XHTML.

    Add support for /all/ attributes defined in the WML DTD, I think
    I've covered the most important ones already, but it's nice to 
    be complete.

    Better HTML to WML conversion.
